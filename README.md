# To-do-list-Chrome-Extension

In this Porject, I have created To- do list which works like a chrome extension.  

For using it, just clone the file to local system, go to manage extensions in chrome settings, turn on the developer mode, click on "load unpacked" and select the folder in which files are.  

You have loaded the extension in your chrome browers and you can use it as you wish.  

P.S- This chrome extension is still under built
